Quantitative Analysis on NitrogenSports Data

You can download a file from NitrogenSports with your entire wager history, and format it as a .txt in plain text, its naturally very organized. This script is meant for filtering out your wager results (including ROI, Records, and Profit) using various bet types (ML, Spread, OverUnder) and various sports. 

Although it started out as a personal script and customized specifically for me, I'm expecting this to become a more general tool for anyone. Perhaps even generalize it for sportsbooks beyond Nitrogen. All you would have to do is put your wagers.txt file in the same directory as these scripts and let it rip.

Feel free to fork and help build this up for all of us sports gamblers!

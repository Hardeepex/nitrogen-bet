Quantitative Analysis on Nitrogen Sports Data

You can download a file from Nitrogen-Sports with your entire wager history, and format it as a .txt in plain text. This script is meant for filtering out your wager results (including ROI, Records, and Profit) using various bet types and various sports. 

Although it started out as a personal script and customized specifically for me, I'm expecting this to become a more general tool for anyone. All you would have to do is put your wagers.txt file in the same directory as these scripts and let em rip.

Feel free to pull and help build this up for all of us sports gamblers!

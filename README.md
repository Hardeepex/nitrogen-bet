# NitrogenSports-Analysis
Quantitative Analysis on NitrogenSports Data

This script is meant for filtering out your wager results (including ROI, Records, and Profit) using various bet types (ML, Spread, OverUnder) and various sports. 

# Setup
Download a file from NitrogenSports with your entire wager history, and format it as a .txt in plain text. Put the wagers.txt file in the same directory as these scripts and run `python3 analysis.py`. You will have to update the analysis.py script for a different filter.

# About
Although it started out as a personal script and customized specifically for me, I'm expecting this to become a more general tool for anyone. Perhaps even generalize it for sportsbooks beyond Nitrogen. 

Feel free to fork and help build this up for all of us sports gamblers!
